# Standard Deviation
#
#  The Standard Deviation indicates how consistent a set of data is.
#  It shows to what extent the individual data points deviate from the
#+ arithmetic mean, i.e., how much they "bounce around" (or cluster).
#  It is essentially the average deviation-distance of the
#+ data points from the mean.

# =========================================================== #
#    To calculate the Standard Deviation:
#
# 1  Find the arithmetic mean (average) of all the data points.
# 2  Subtract each data point from the arithmetic mean,
#    and square that difference.
# 3  Add all of the individual difference-squares in # 2.
# 4  Divide the sum in # 3 by the number of data points.
#    This is known as the "variance."
# 5  The square root of # 4 gives the Standard Deviation.
