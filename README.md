# RestingState
Scripts for the processing of resting state images (MRI)

These scripts streamline our ongoing edits to the 2014a and 2017a scripts. In these scripts, we'll no longer provide option of intermediate
processing with melodic, since ica-aroma provides this for us. We instead integrate option of using ica-aroma for denoising before running
a aCompcor nuisance regression.
